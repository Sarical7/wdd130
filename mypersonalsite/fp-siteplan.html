                <p>
                    The challenge in selling a clothing line is that you have to maintain your artistic vision while also trying to include designs that are trendy,
                    popular and appealing.

                <h2>Site Map and Content</h2>
                <p> The majority of businesses have a fascinating backstory, even if the bottom line is that they were founded just to make more money. Rather than picking a style at random, consider what you want to bring to what's currently out there: luxury, quality, low-cost alternatives, more sizes, or even an entirely new style. It's worth thinking about to create a foundation for my brand that will also act as a guide in the future as well for the customer.
