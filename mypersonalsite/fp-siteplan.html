            <h3>Site Map and Content</h3>
           <p>
            The majority of businesses have a fascinating backstory, even if the bottom line is that they were founded just to make more money. Rather than picking a style at random, consider what you want to bring to what's currently out there: luxury, quality, low-cost alternatives, more sizes, or even an entirely new style. It's worth thinking about to create a foundation for my brand that will also act as a guide in the future as well for the customer.
